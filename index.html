                <h3>Get to Know Us</h3>
                <p>International Miracle Church, formerly known as 'Miracle Tamil Assembly of God', was started on
                    December 23rd 1990 with 12 believers. The founding pastor was Rev. Dr. Thomas Gnanasekar; he
                    continues to faithfully serve the Church as its senior pastor to date.</p>
                <p>
                    In spite of starting out small, the Church grew rapidly over the years. In 1993, International
                    Miracle Church saw the largest growth it had ever seen in its history; in fact it was one of the
                    fastest growths the nation of Canada had ever seen. Between the years 1990 and 1995, over 800 new
                    believers were baptized and added to the Body of Christ. International Miracle church thus opened up
                    a new chapter in the history of the Tamil speaking church in Canada. Several other churches were
                    born out of this ministry and the word of God spread across this vast community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today with about 200 believers, International Miracle Church is a growing and dynamic church working
                    with its sole vision of reaching the lost and touching lives with the love of God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Located at 585 Middlefield Rd., Unit #33, in Scarborough, ON, International Miracle Church is
                    marching on in these end times, fulfilling the great commission Jesus gave us: “therefore go and
                    make disciples of all nations.” (Mathew 28:19)

                    <h5>Senior Pastor</h5>
                    <p>Pastor Gnanasekar founded Miracle Church nearly 30 years. Having been in ministry for over 20
                        years prior in India, his fire for saving souls has not dimmed. He has a heart for ministry and
                        desire to see the needs of many met by our gracious Lord through His Church.</p>

                    <h4>Pastor John Gnanasekar</h4>
                    <h5>Associate Pastor</h5>
                    <p>With a heart of worship and a vision for growth, Pastor John carries the same burden for souls as
                        his father. Preaching for both our Tamil and English services, his dedication to his
                        congregation is always evident. But his commitments never stop him from making time for a coffee
                        and chat. He'll always have an uplifting word to share with you.</p>

                    <h5>Youth Pastor</h5>
                    <p>Youths take a certain kind of energy and Pastor Phil has that and more! A never-ending source of
                        encouragement, he seeks to help make youths feel welcome and connected. From snowy England to
                        sunny Brazil, we're glad Pastor Phil is back home in Canada with us.</p>
