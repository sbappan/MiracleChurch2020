                <h3>Get to Know Us</h3>
                <p>International Miracle Church, formerly known as 'Miracle Tamil Assembly of God', was started on
                    December 23rd 1990 with 12 believers. The founding pastor was Rev. Dr. Thomas Gnanasekar; he
                    continues to faithfully serve the Church as its senior pastor to date.</p>
                <p>
                    In spite of starting out small, the Church grew rapidly over the years. In 1993, International
                    Miracle Church saw the largest growth it had ever seen in its history; in fact it was one of the
                    fastest growths the nation of Canada had ever seen. Between the years 1990 and 1995, over 800 new
                    believers were baptized and added to the Body of Christ. International Miracle church thus opened up
                    a new chapter in the history of the Tamil speaking church in Canada. Several other churches were
                    born out of this ministry and the word of God spread across this vast community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today with about 200 believers, International Miracle Church is a growing and dynamic church working
                    with its sole vision of reaching the lost and touching lives with the love of God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Located at 585 Middlefield Rd., Unit #33, in Scarborough, ON, International Miracle Church is
                    marching on in these end times, fulfilling the great commission Jesus gave us: “therefore go and
                    make disciples of all nations.” (Mathew 28:19)

                    <h5>Senior Pastor</h5>
                    <p>Pastor Gnanasekar founded Miracle Church nearly 30 years. Having been in ministry for over 20
                        years prior in India, his fire for saving souls has not dimmed. He has a heart for ministry and
                        desire to see the needs of many met by our gracious Lord through His Church.</p>

                    <h5>Associate Pastor</h5>
                    <p>With a heart of worship and a vision for growth, Pastor John carries the same burden for souls as
                        his father. Preaching for both our Tamil and English services, his dedication to his
                        congregation is always evident. But his commitments never stop him from making time for a coffee
                        and chat. He'll always have an uplifting word to share with you.</p>

                    <p>Youths take a certain kind of energy and Pastor Phil has that and more! A never-ending source of
                        encouragement, he seeks to help make youths feel welcome and connected. From snowy England to
                        sunny Brazil, we're glad Pastor Phil is back home in Canada with us.</p>

                    <h5>Missions in Sri Lanka</h5>
                    <p>
                        ʻNew Beginningsʼ is the compassionate arm of International Miracle Mission Inc. (A Registered
                        Canadian Charity - Registration No. 874660426) that currently operates in Sri Lanka.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sri Lanka is a beautiful island nation in the Indian ocean that has been ravaged by over three
                        decades of gruesome civil war. Today, the war has ended and things seem to have returned to
                        normal. There are no actual sights or sounds of war, but the cruel effects of the war still
                        linger on in many parts of the island.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Especially in the Mullivaikal community that we work in, we have come across so many tragic
                        stories, so many broken lives, and so much heartache everywhere. The things we have witnessed
                        here is heart breaking. Far more debilitating than the loss of material possessions or lives is
                        the loss of a person's self-worth; the self-esteem and morale of people has been crushed. Those
                        who survived the war are in a seemingly worse shape than those who perished. They are alive, yet
                        without a purpose in life; they awake each morning with the sunrise, but are still imprisoned in
                        the dark night of their futile lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our vision is to ultimately see the Mullivaikal community restored through the work done by ʻNew
                        Beginnings'. In order to see this transformation take place, we believe that peoples’ lives need
                        to be rebuilt first. We want to see people revitalized and given a sense of purpose and
                        direction. We invite you to learn more about our work and play a part in this rebuilding
                        process.

                    <h5>Miracle Academy of Biblical Studies</h5>
                    <p>
                        Miracle Academy of Biblical Studies was established in September 2005 as the fruition of a God
                        given vision to our founder, Rev. Dr. Thomas Gnanasekar. Throughout his nearly 45 years of
                        ministry, the Lord has used Rev. Gnanasekar to train up and equip several hundreds of pastors
                        and evangelists and lay workers who serve in God’s Kingdom all over the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although he has always been training leaders and workers in the local Church context, it has
                        been Rev. Gnanasekar’s passion to see an accredited Bible College established. The Lord gave
                        Rev. Gnanasekar this vision in 1975 while he was in prayer on a mountaintop in Chennai, India.
                        30 years later, his vision came to pass with the help of Rev. Dr. John McDonald who was the
                        director of Proximity Institutes at Canada Christian College at the time.
                    </p>

                        MABS, although initially started in Toronto, Ontario, has now expanded into Montreal, New
                        Jersey, UK, Quatar, India and Sri Lanka. Over 650 students have graduated from MABS and serve
                        the Lord in various capacities their local churches.
